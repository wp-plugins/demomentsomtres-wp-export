DeMomentSomTres Export to help exporting filtered WordPress data with required attachment files that usually get lost.

== Description ==

DeMomentSomTres Export was build because [DeMomentSomTres](http://demomentsomtres.com) had a customer with a very big blog that had to be imported with all attachments.

This plugin is a modified version of the export procedure.

Standard export procedure can be recovered unistalling or deactivating this plugin.
